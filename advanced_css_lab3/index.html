                    Formed in 1968 in Birmingham, Black Sabbath is an English rock band known for pioneering heavy metal music. With Tony Iommi on guitar, Bill Ward on drums, Geezer Butler on bass, and Ozzy Osbourne on vocals, the band's early albums like Black Sabbath (1970), Paranoid (1970), and Master of Reality (1971) defined the genre. Despite lineup changes after Osbourne's departure in 1979, Tony Iommi remained a constant member, ensuring the band's enduring legacy.

                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>
                        After evolving from the Polka Tulk Blues Band and Earth, the group adopted the name Black Sabbath in 1969. Known for their occult themes, horror-inspired lyrics, and heavy, down-tuned guitars, they signed with Philips Records in November 1969 and released their debut single "Evil Woman" in January 1970, followed by their first album, Black Sabbath, the next month. Despite initial critical backlash, the album achieved commercial success, paving the way for their acclaimed follow-up, Paranoid, later that year. With subsequent albums like Sabbath Bloody Sabbath (1973), Vol. 4 (1972), Sabotage (1975), Technical Ecstasy (1976), and Never Say Die! (1978), the band ventured into experimental and progressive styles, earning positive responses from critics and expanding their fanbase.

                    <h3>Influence</h3>
                    <p><i>"They were and still are a groundbreaking band...you can put on the first Black Sabbath album and it still sounds as fresh today as it did 30-odd years ago. And that's because great music has a timeless ability: To me, Sabbath are in the same league as the Beatles or Mozart. They're on the leading edge of something extraordinary."</i> - Rob Halford, Vocalist of Judas Priest

                    <br>
                    <i>"The heaviest, scariest, coolest riffs and the apocalyptic Ozzy wail are without peer. You can hear the despair and menace of the working-class Birmingham streets they came from in every kick-ass, evil groove. Their arrival ground hippy, flower-power psychedelia to a pulp and set the standard for all heavy bands to come."</i> - Tom Morello, Guitarist for Rage Against The Machine

                    <i>"I always get the question in every interview I do, 'What are your top five metal albums?' I make it easy for myself and always say the first five Sabbath albums."</i> - Scott Ian, Guitarist for Anthrax

                    <h3>Style</h3>
                    <p>Black Sabbath's core sound, characterized by ominous lyrics and doomy music, often employs the musical tritone, known as the "devil's interval." Despite lineup changes and stylistic evolution, their music maintains this dark essence. Albums from their Ozzy Osbourne era, like Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, showed slight compositional nods to the growing progressive rock trend but stood in stark contrast to the mainstream music of the early 1970s. Critically dismissed during that era, Black Sabbath and their early heavy metal peers received minimal airplay on rock radio.</p>
