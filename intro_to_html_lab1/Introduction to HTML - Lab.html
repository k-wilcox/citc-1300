        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Chattanooga, a city with a rich past, began as a Native American settlement before European settlers arrived in the late 18th century. Its strategic location along the Tennessee River and railroad lines made it vital during the Civil War, earning it the nickname "The Gateway to the Deep South." Post-war, Chattanooga thrived as an industrial center, particularly in iron and textiles. Today, the city balances its historic roots with modern innovation, boasting a vibrant downtown, preserved landmarks, and a focus on outdoor recreation and the arts.</p>
